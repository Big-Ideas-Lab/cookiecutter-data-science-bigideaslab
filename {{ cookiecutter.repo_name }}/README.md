## Getting started with this repo (all collaborators)
1. Create your environment (e.g. conda environment) in terminal:
```bash
make create_environment
```
2. Activate your environment in terminal:
   
For example, `conda activate {{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}`

3. Load environment requirements in terminal
```bash
make requirements
```


## Using Notebooks
Use the following jupyter notebook magic to make sure latest changes to imported .py files don't require restarting the kernel to take into effect

```Python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```
